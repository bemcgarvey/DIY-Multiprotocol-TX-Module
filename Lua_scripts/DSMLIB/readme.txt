This script library is a rewrite of the original DSM forward programming Lua 
Script.  The goal is to make it easier to understand, mantain, and to  
separate the GUI from the DSM Forward  programming engine/logic
in this way, GUIs can evolve independent. OpenTX Gui, EdgeTx GUI, etc.

Code is based on the code/work by: Pascal Langer (Author of the Multi-Module) 
Rewrite/Enhancements By: Francisco Arzu 



Deployment:
/SCRIPTS/TOOLS/DsmFwdPrg_05_BaW.lua		-- OpenTX/EdgeTx version, no touch (black/white radios)
/SCRIPTS/TOOLS/DsmFwdPrg_05_Color.lua		-- EdgeTX/OpenTx Color version, +touch
/SCRIPTS/TOOLS/DSMLIB/				-- Libraries (ALL CAPITALS) to hide them from the Tools menu
/SCRIPTS/TOOLS/DSMLIB/DsmFwPrgLib.lub		-- DSM Protocol Message and Menu engine
/SCRIPTS/TOOLS/DSMLIB/DsmFwPrgSIMLib.lub	-- Simulation of AR631 for GUI Development in Companion

/LOGS/dsm_log.txt				-- Readable log of the last RX session, usefull for debuging new RX


Version 0.5
- Make the code more readable and understadable
- Separate the DSM Forwards Programing logic from the GUI
- Log the comunnication with the RX on a /LOGS/dsm_log.txt to allow to debug it easier 
	and see the exchange of data between the RX/TX
- Created a black/white version with only Key/Roller Inputs (OTX)
- Created a nicer GUI for EdgeTX touchscreen color Radios
- RX simulation for GUI development:  turn on SIMULATION_ON=true in the beginning of the lua file


Some settings that can change (top of Lua file):
	SIMULATION_ON = false   -- FALSE: use real communication to DSM RX (DEFAULT), TRUE: use a simulated version of RX 
	DEBUG_ON = 1           -- 0=NO DEBUG, 1=HIGH LEVEL 2=LOW LEVEL   (Debug logged into the /LOGS/dsm_log.txt)
	DEBUG_ON_LCD = false   -- Interactive Information on LCD of Menu data from RX 
	USE_SPECKTRUM_COLORS = true -- true: Use spectrum colors, false: use theme colors (default on OpenTX) 


Known Problems:
1. Some Menu List line types (LINE_TYPE.LIST_MENU1 or "L_m1" in logs), the range (min/max) seems to be incorrect, but cannot see in the data how to fix it
	Some of the valid values are not even sequential, very spread apart. There has to be a list of valid options somewhere (in RX or config for each field).
2. The RX return unknow lines when requesting the Lines for a menu. Realy don't understand what they are for.
	in some menus, seems to stay stuck in the same return line or no response to the request, making the RX reset/close the connection.
	Was able to hack it for AR631 "First Time Setup" and "First Time SAFE Setup", but still happen on "Servo Realm" and others in that menu.
