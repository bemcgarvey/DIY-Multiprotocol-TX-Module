# MPM for Flysky PL18

The PCB design is located in PL18_multiprotocol folder and is designed using KiCad 6.0.

The casing is located in Casing folder and is designed using Blender 3.3.1.  The model included 2 pieces, T is the top piece and B is the bottom pieces.  These 2 pieces is cloned into TF and BF respectively to apply all modifiers and make manifold for 3D printing.  I have included the stl files generated for simplity.
